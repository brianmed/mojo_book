The code samples use ' rather than ' so they will not compile should anyone
wish to copy-paste.

Some people cannot copy without the line numbers.

Expand on concepts and provide intro material on HTML, CSS, maybe
Javascript/jQuery and Perl.

Async DB Example
    Render later
    Timer
    Delay

JSON API Example
    Headers
    Custom Headers
    Content negotiation

Plugins
Testing
Excercises
Mojo::Base
Route hooks

CLI script
    Mojo::IOLoop
    Mojo::UserAgent
    Mojo::DOM usage

Naming consitency with examples

Perhaps show a filename above examples

Add a POST form example

Add a jQuery AJAX example

Debugging

Explain MVC

Add https setup

Add CSRF section

Augment ex4_cli.pl and add a concurrent request..

Make clearer that snippets are broken up - possibly with sequential line
numbers.

You installed perl 5.20.1 in the instructions, but I don't think you used any
of its features. I would just remove that bit and assume everyone has perl >=
5.10.

Better quantify assumptions on knowledge of Perl, unix/linux, development
environment.

Add blurb about secure_compare and other Mojolicious features not written
about.

# ZoffixWork
# bpmedley, RE: http://bmedley.org/mojo.pdf  The immediate concern is all the
# hyphens in shell commands in the book are actually UTF8 minus signs, so it
# makes it impossible to copy-paste them (I'm assuming the book *will* be
# available in digital format) and copy/pasting code examples leaves spaces
# after nearly every character. You also keep using full paths to morbo, et.
# al. and I don't think that's necessary and should be avoided f
# 12:15		or clarity. <html>, <head>, and <body> are all optional tags.
#    Perhaps, it will be clearer if they are omitted in the code examples (at
#    least in Hello World example) to simplify overall snippet. In fact, I
#    think the "Getting Started" section on homepage of http://mojolicio.us/ is
#    the perfect example to use: it's just 3 lines. To the uninitiated, it'll
#    likely be confusing why you first use Lite and the full apps. I think
#    there shoul
# 12:15		d be a section explaining the purpose of Lite apps. There should be
#    a section (say, section 0.7.0) explaining the MVC concept. People
#    unfamiliar with it with get confused right when you start talking about
#    Controllers. The code example after section 0.7.2 looks really messy. I
#    think it should be written with 70-col, or so, max line width so there
#    would be no wraps. I also don't think this form for dereference is the
#    common one: $$
# 12:15		site_config{hypnotoad_ip}
# 12:16		Sorry for the noise... Anyway, that's my two cents.

# ajr_: bpmedley; you might also want to make it explicit what you expect the
# reader to know before they start reading. Keep things as simple as possible.
# There are so many packages around today, it's impossible to know them all.
